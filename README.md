# ðŸ§© Maze Solver Game (8x8 LED + Joystick + Buzzer)

Navigate your way out of a challenging 8x8 LED maze using a joystick, while "Flight of the Bumblebee" plays in the background on a buzzer. Compact, addictive, and Arduino-powered.

---

## ðŸŽ® Gameplay

- Move your player using the joystick.
- Avoid the walls and find the path to the exit.
- The buzzer plays a simplified version of *Flight of the Bumblebee* on loop.

## ðŸ”§ How It Works

- The maze is hardcoded in an 8x8 binary array.
- Movement is smoothed and limited by a delay.
- Only open paths (`0`s) are allowed.
- The buzzer plays tones in sequence to mimic the classic melody.

## ðŸ§  Maze Pattern

Each byte represents one row of the maze (`1` = wall, `0` = path):
